# Portfolio assignment for Class 3

Here's what you need to do on the portfolio for today:

- Create a new branch called `class-03` for today's work.
- Use media queries as needed to build the CSS for the desktop view of your portfolio.
- Use jQuery to set up tab-based navigation as you did in the blog assignment today
- ADD, COMMIT, PUSH
- Next, and only after the prior steps and ACP are complete, start adding in content, focusing on the things you'd like to have on your Social page (which should feature a few things about you personally, such as interests, hobbies, etc.)
- When finished, ACP again, merge the branch into master, and be sure to pull master back into your local master branch
- Submit the link to your pull request in Canvas
